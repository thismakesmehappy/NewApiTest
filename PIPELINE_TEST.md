# CI/CD Pipeline Testing

## Advanced Pipeline Features Test

This file is created to test the advanced CI/CD pipeline patterns implemented:

### Features to Test:
1. **Promotion Blockers** - Concurrency groups prevent parallel deployments
2. **Route-Aware Conflicts** - Dev vs staging/prod route isolation  
3. **Smart Cancellation** - Superseded deployment detection

### Test Scenarios:
- [ ] Main branch commit → staging/production route
- [ ] Commit with `[deploy-dev]` → development route only
- [ ] Multiple rapid commits → supersession handling

### Pipeline Status:
✅ Advanced concurrency controls deployed (commit 0ef9272)
✅ Smart cancellation logic implemented  
✅ Route-aware conflict detection active

**Next**: Test concurrent deployment scenarios
