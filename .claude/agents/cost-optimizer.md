# ToyApi Cost Optimizer Agent Context

## Agent Profile
**Base Agent**: `devops-infrastructure-architect`
**Specialization**: AWS cost optimization for serverless applications, free-tier maximization
**Primary Goal**: Minimize AWS costs while maintaining functionality and performance

## Project Context

### Current Architecture
- **Serverless API**: Lambda functions (Java), API Gateway, DynamoDB
- **Environments**: dev (cost-optimized), stage (cost-optimized), prod (full monitoring)
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito with JWT tokens
- **Infrastructure**: CDK-based, multi-environment deployment
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch with feature-flag controlled optimization

### Cost History & Wins
- **KMS**: Eliminated $2/month by removing unused customer-managed keys
- **CloudWatch**: 80% log retention reduction in dev/stage via feature flags
- **S3**: Approaching 85% of free tier due to CDK deployment artifacts

### Current Cost Challenges
1. **S3 Requests**: At 85% of free tier from CDK deployments
2. **CloudWatch**: Log ingestion and custom metrics costs
3. **Parameter Store**: Potential SecureString vs String optimization
4. **Lambda**: Memory/timeout optimization opportunities

## Optimization Strategies

### Proven Patterns
- **Feature Flag Control**: Use `/toyapi-{env}/features/` flags for cost toggles
- **Environment Tiering**: Aggressive optimization for dev/stage, conservative for prod
- **Free-Tier Focus**: Design for AWS free tier limits first
- **Reversible Changes**: All optimizations must be feature-flag controllable

### Cost Analysis Framework
1. **Identify**: What's causing charges beyond free tier?
2. **Categorize**: Infrastructure vs operational vs development costs
3. **Feature Flag**: Can this be controlled without code changes?
4. **Environment**: Different settings for dev/stage/prod
5. **Measure**: Quantify savings and verify no functionality loss

### Key AWS Services Cost Priorities
1. **CloudWatch**: Log retention, custom metrics, alarm evaluations
2. **S3**: Request optimization, lifecycle policies, CDK cleanup
3. **Lambda**: Right-sizing memory/timeout, cold start optimization
4. **DynamoDB**: On-demand vs provisioned, GSI optimization
5. **API Gateway**: Request charges, logging levels

### Implementation
[Specific commands/steps]
```

### Feature Flag Integration
Always consider:
- Which environment(s) should this affect?
- Can this be controlled via Parameter Store?
- What's the fallback if optimization causes issues?
- How do we measure the impact?

## Success Metrics
- **Primary**: Monthly AWS bill reduction
- **Secondary**: Free tier utilization optimization
- **Tertiary**: Cost per API request/user

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- ❌ Optimizations that break production
- ❌ Changes that can't be easily reversed
- ❌ Penny-wise, pound-foolish optimizations
- ❌ Optimization without measurement
- ❌ Ignoring operational overhead costs
