# Deployment Approval Setup

This document explains how to configure the deployment approval gate that protects your production deployments.

## 🛡️ How It Works

When someone pushes to `main`, the pipeline:
1. **Stops at approval gate** - Waits for manual approval
2. **Shows deployment details** - Who, what, when
3. **Requires approval** - Only approved users can proceed
4. **Runs full pipeline** - Tests → Staging → Production

## 🔧 Setup Required

### Step 1: Create the Environment
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Click **Settings** → **Environments**
3. Click **New environment**
4. Name: `deployment-approval`

### Step 2: Configure Protection Rules
In the `deployment-approval` environment:

1. **Required reviewers**: Add yourself (`thismakesmehappy`)
2. **Deployment branches**: Restrict to `main` branch only
3. **Environment secrets**: None needed (inherits from repository)

### Step 3: Test the Setup
1. Push to `main` branch
2. Go to **Actions** tab
3. See workflow waiting at "Deployment Approval"
4. Click **Review deployments** → **Approve and deploy**

## 🎯 What This Protects

✅ **Unauthorized deployments** - No one can deploy without approval  
✅ **Accidental pushes** - Manual review before any deployment  
✅ **Full pipeline protection** - One approval covers staging + production  
✅ **Audit trail** - All deployments logged with approver  

## 🚨 Emergency Bypass

For urgent fixes, use the manual deployment workflow:
1. Go to **Actions** → **Manual Deployment**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Select environment and deploy

## 📋 Environment Setup Commands

You can also create the environment via GitHub CLI:

```bash
# Create environment
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/environments/deployment-approval -X PUT

# Add protection rules (requires web UI)
echo "Visit: https://github.com/thismakesmehappy/TestAWSAPI2/settings/environments"
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

**Pipeline stuck?** → Check if `deployment-approval` environment exists  
**No approval button?** → Ensure you're added as required reviewer  
**Still deploying without approval?** → Check environment protection rules

**Next Step**: Go to GitHub Settings → Environments and create `deployment-approval`
